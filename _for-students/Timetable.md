## Timetable

As students will be having Home-Based Learning (HBL) day once a fortnight, students will have an odd and even week timetable from Semester 1.

Students are reminded to refer to their timetables and pack their bags accordingly.

**Class Timetable 2023** (Term 3 Week 2 onwards)

Please refer to your class timetable:
