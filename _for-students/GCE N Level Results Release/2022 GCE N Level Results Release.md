Dear 4NA/NT Students,

will be released on Monday, 19 December 2022 at 2pm in School Hall. Parents/guardians may accompany their child/ward to school to collect the results.

They have the option of accessing their results online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates Portal at [www.seab.gov.sg](www.seab.gov.sg) from 2.45pm on Monday, 19 December 2022 till 11.59pm on Friday, 30 December 2022.

Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification when collecting the results. Form Teachers must be informed on proxies’ details prior to results release.
