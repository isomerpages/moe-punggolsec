<p><strong>Q: When will my locker be allocated?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: It usually takes about 10 working days. However, every year, there
is a large number students who continues to use the lockers after it expires.
Hence, we need to check that the expired lockers are empty before allocating
it. Please be patient.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My locker has expired but I would like to renew.</strong>

Please re-apply for a locker for the next academic year when the online
new booking opens.</p>

<p>A: The school key is a password that is issued to your school administrator.
This password will be disseminated to students of your school to prevent
unauthorised people from booking. However, we have decided to temporarily
disable this feature.</p>
