<p><strong><u>For Parents:</u></strong>
<br><strong>Supporting Your Teen through the O-Level Results Release</strong>
</p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>The 2025 O-Level results will be released soon. While we await the results,
let us also remember to celebrate their efforts, regardless of the results.
We can show support for our teens by showing them through our words and
actions that their grades do not define who they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your support to your teen during this milestone is important. Use this
opportunity to have open conversations and guide them as they consider
their next steps.&nbsp;</p>
