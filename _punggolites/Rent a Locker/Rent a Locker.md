lockers in 2025 is $26/year.</p>
<p>b. Locker rental comes with a 4-digit lock. During the rental period,
students are responsible for the hygiene and general upkeep of the lockers.
If students damage or misplace the lock, they will have to be fully responsible
for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>c. Students must use their own school email address xxx@students.edu.sg
to register as a new user or as existing user of school locker. Students
must also indicate their 2025 Class and Register Number (at the Matrix
Number column) when booking their new lockers.</p>
<p>d. 2025 Sec 2 and 4 students will be informed of their 2025 class and
register number by 27 Nov. They may register for their new lockers from
Dec 1 – Dec 15. Students may start to use their assigned lockers from 8
Jan 2025.</p>
<p>e. 2025 Sec 3 students may register for their new lockers from 27 Dec

Dec. Students may start to use their lockers from 8 Jan 2025.</p>
