# Instructions to Book a Locker for 2025 

 
To book a locker in 2025, please note the following: 
a.	Rental fee for lockers in 2025 is $26/year. 
 
b.	Locker rental comes with a 4-digit lock. During the rental period, students are responsible for the hygiene and general upkeep of the lockers. If students damage or misplace the lock, they will have to be fully responsible for any costs incurred. 
 
c.	Students must use their own school email address xxx@students.edu.sg to register as a new user or as existing user of school locker. Students must also indicate their 2025 Class and Register Number (at the Matrix Number column) when booking their new lockers.  
 
d.	2025 Sec 2 and 4 students will be informed of their 2025 class and register number by 27 Nov. They may register for their new lockers from Dec 1 – Dec 15. Students may start to use their assigned lockers from 8 Jan 2025. 
 
e.	2025 Sec 3 students may register for their new lockers from 27 Dec as the school will need more time to finalise the 2025 classes and register numbers due to the Sec 3 Subject Combination Exercise. The school will inform all Sec 3 students of their new class and register number by 27 Dec. Students may start to use their lockers from 8 Jan 2025.
