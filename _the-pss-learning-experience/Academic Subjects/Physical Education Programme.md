<p>The Physical Education Department, through the learning of sports, games
and outdoor learning, provides opportunities for every Punggolite to acquire
the skills and knowledge to build their character and values. We aim to
prepare them to be active, healthy and future-ready individuals.</p>
<p>It is critical for students to enjoy learning. Fun-filled school events
like the Secondary One Cohort Adventure Camp, Annual Cross Country, and
Games Carnival Recreational Competitions provide ample opportunities for
students to develop self-management, social awareness and, while practicing
communication and collaborative skills when working in groups. These are
essential skills to prepare students for their future beyond school.</p>
