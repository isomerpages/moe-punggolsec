<p>The English Language and Literature Department aims to equip Punggolites
with strong language competencies through various strategies and engaging
programmes both within and outside the classroom. Teacher feedback and
peer assessment develop students’ critical thinking and encourage Punggolites
to be reflective learners. Online group projects develop students’ communication,
organisation, and teamwork skills, which are essential in future workplaces.
In addition, our library programmes foster a love for reading and promote
lifelong learning. By integrating technology with the department’s approaches
to learning, Punggolites become self-directed learners with the necessary
life skills and dispositions to navigate future challenges.</p>
