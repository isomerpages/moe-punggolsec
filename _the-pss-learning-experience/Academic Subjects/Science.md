## Science

The Science Department aspires to ignite in our students the passion for learning Science and provide students with opportunities to expose them to scientific applications so that they are able to link real life application of Science to what they learn in school.

  

We provide opportunities for all students to learn science to the best of their ability in their years at Punggol Secondary School.

  

We have an in-house Science Enrichment Programme to ignite in our students the passion for learning Science and to expose them to scientific applications so that they could link real life application of Science to what they learn in school.

  

We also prepare students for relevant competitions so that they are able to develop their 21st century world skills such as presentation and public speaking. In the midst of preparing for the competitions, students are also engaged in scientific research and report writing.

**_Science Buskers Festival organised by Singapore Science Centre_**

  

Science Buskers is a festival that encompasses the idea of developing students’ communication skills through the expression of science in creative manners. Organised as a competition, this event serves as an excellent platform to spread key messages relating to the importance of inspiring an interest in science. During the competition, contestants will do a "show-and-tell" on any science topic and judging will be based on audiences' votes and judges' scores.

  

Three teams of Lower Secondary Science students in the Science Buskers Festival audition round in July. One of the teams made it to the finals and competed against 18 schools in the finals round (Secondary) category.

Through the entire competition, our students established excellent research and presentation skills. In addition, they understand the importance of teamwork and excel in the task assigned to them.
