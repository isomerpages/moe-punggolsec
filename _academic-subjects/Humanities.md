<p>The Humanities Department aims to develop adaptable, self-directed learners
who actively contribute to society. Through subjects like history, geography,
and social studies, students enhance their critical thinking, communication,
and ethical reasoning skills. These subjects prepare students to apply
these skills in diverse and challenging situations. By fostering curiosity
and a love for lifelong learning, our teachers empower students to take
charge of their own education and confidently navigate a rapidly changing
world. Learning about how past generations overcame adversity helps students
appreciate human resilience and inspires them to face their challenges
with determination.</p>
