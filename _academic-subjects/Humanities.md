*Geography field trip*

The Humanities Department aims to develop adaptable, self-directed learners who actively contribute to society. Through subjects like history, geography, and social studies, students enhance their critical thinking, communication, and ethical reasoning skills. These subjects prepare students to apply these skills in diverse and challenging situations. By fostering curiosity and a love for lifelong learning, our teachers empower students to take charge of their own education and confidently navigate a rapidly changing world. Learning about how past generations overcame adversity helps students appreciate human resilience and inspires them to face their challenges with determination.
