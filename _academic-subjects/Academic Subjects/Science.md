<p>Science Department leverages the use of technology to engage students
in their learning trajectories and prepare them to be future-ready as technology
gains emphasis in the future workplace. Technology is used to promote collaborative
learning and co-creation of knowledge so that students can appreciate how
scientific knowledge is reliable and repeatable. Students are given opportunity
during science lessons to use their personal learning devices to tap on
the affordances of technology to enhance their learning. The use of gamification
makes lessons more engaging.</p>
