## Mathematics

The Mathematics Department is committed to develop in our students a positive attitude towards Mathematics. We believe that all students can succeed and we aim to bring out the best in them.  

  

### Department Programmes and Events


  

**_Secondary One Mathematics Games Day_**

  

The Mathematics Games Day inculcates the joy of learning in Mathematics and is organised yearly in May for all Secondary One students. While playing the games at various stations, students learn a variety of mathematical concepts and applications (eg. financial literacy) as well as improve their analytical and problem-solving skills. They also learn how to work collaboratively with their peers as they navigate the various stations as a team.

**_Secondary Two STEM Trail_**

  

This trail has been organised in collaboration with the Science department as a post-end-of-year exam activity since 2017. The objective of this trail is to provide students with opportunities to apply mathematical concepts and hone their problem-solving skills in a real-world context.

**_Secondary Two Peer Tutoring Programme_**

  

The Mathematics Peer Tutoring Programme provides a platform for our Secondary Two Express students who demonstrate higher abilities in Mathematics, to tutor Secondary One Express students.

  

In the after-school weekly sessions, the identified peer tutors will guide their juniors in completing Mathematics worksheets. Through this programme, our Secondary Two Express students strengthen their communication and reasoning skills, while becoming more confident speakers and learners.

  

As part of this programme, we also collaborated with neighbouring primary schools:

*   Edgefield Primary School (2014)
*   Greendale Primary School (2015 to 2018)

**_Secondary 1NA Mathematics Bridging Programme_**

  

Secondary 1NA students who have been identified to undergo this programme are placed under the guidance of Mathematics teachers and are provided with suitable learning materials to help strengthen their foundation in Mathematics. This provision of learning support for Mathematics will in turn help students to cope with the demands of secondary school Mathematics.
