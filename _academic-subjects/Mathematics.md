# Mathematics

 The Mathematics Department aims to develop Punggolites into resilient problem solvers with a positive attitude towards Mathematics. The department leverages on a baseline curriculum with suitable pedagogies and assessment strategies to strengthen the teaching and learning of mathematical problem-solving skills. Programmes like Peer Tutoring Programme, Foundation to N(A) Bridging, Secondary One Games Day and Secondary Three Math Trail provide a motivating environment to learn Mathematics and solve problems in real world contexts. Students learn how to be an active contributor as they work collaboratively to support one another in problem-solving.
 

### Department Programmes and Events

  

**Secondary One Mathematics Games Day**

The Mathematics Games Day inculcates the joy of learning in Mathematics and is organised yearly for all Secondary One students. While playing the games at various stations, students learn a variety of mathematical concepts and applications (eg. financial literacy) as well as improve their analytical and problem-solving skills. They also learn how to work collaboratively with their peers as they navigate the various stations as a team.

**_Secondary Two Peer Tutoring Programme_**

The Mathematics Peer Tutoring Programme provides a platform for  Secondary Two Express students who demonstrate higher abilities in Mathematics, to tutor Secondary One Express students.

During these sessions, the identified peer tutors will guide their juniors in completing Mathematics worksheets. This programme provides opportunities for collaborative learning. In addition, peer tutors will be more confident and be instilled in our school values of propriety, righteousness and self-respect.
