# Mathematics

 The Mathematics Department aims to develop Punggolites into resilient problem solvers with a positive attitude towards Mathematics. The department leverages on a baseline curriculum with suitable pedagogies and assessment strategies to strengthen the teaching and learning of mathematical problem-solving skills. Programmes like Peer Tutoring Programme, Foundation to N(A) Bridging, Secondary One Games Day and Secondary Three Math Trail provide a motivating environment to learn Mathematics and solve problems in real world contexts. Students learn how to be an active contributor as they work collaboratively to support one another in problem-solving.
 

### Department Programmes and Events

  

**_Secondary One Mathematics Games Day_**

The Mathematics Games Day inculcates the joy of learning in Mathematics and is organised yearly for all Secondary One students. While playing the games at various stations, students learn a variety of mathematical concepts and applications (eg. financial literacy) as well as improve their analytical and problem-solving skills. They also learn how to work collaboratively with their peers as they navigate the various stations as a team.

**_Secondary Three Math Trail_**

Math Trail is organised yearly for  Secondary Three students. As students explore math concepts and solve problems in a real-world context, they are able to see the relevance of what they are learning and how it applies to their lives. By successfully completing tasks and achieving goals, students can build confidence in their math skills and feel motivated to continue learning. Through this active and collaborative learning experience, students develop a love for math that extends beyond the classroom.

**_Secondary Two Peer Tutoring Programme_**

  

The Mathematics Peer Tutoring Programme provides a platform for  Secondary Two Express students who demonstrate higher abilities in Mathematics, to tutor Secondary One Express students.

During these sessions, the identified peer tutors will guide their juniors in completing Mathematics worksheets. This programme provides opportunities for collaborative learning. In addition, peer tutors will be more confident and be instilled in our school values of propriety, righteousness and self-respect.

**_Secondary 1NA Mathematics Bridging Programme_**

  

Secondary 1NA students who have been identified to undergo this programme are placed under the guidance of Mathematics teachers and are provided with suitable learning materials to help strengthen their foundation in Mathematics. This provision of learning support for Mathematics  help students to cope with the demands of secondary school Mathematics.
