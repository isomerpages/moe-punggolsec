 The English Language and Literature Department aims to equip Punggolites with strong language competencies through various strategies and engaging programmes both within and outside the classroom. Teacher feedback and peer assessment develop students’ critical thinking and encourage Punggolites to be reflective learners. Online group projects develop students’ communication, organisation, and teamwork skills, which are essential in future workplaces. In addition, our library programmes foster a love for reading and promote lifelong learning. By integrating technology with the department’s approaches to learning, Punggolites become self-directed learners with the necessary life skills and dispositions to navigate future challenges.
