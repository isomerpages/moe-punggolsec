## Science

Science department leverages the use of technology to engage students in their learning trajectories and prepare them to be future-ready as technology gains emphasis in the future workplace. Technology is used to promote collaborative learning and co-creation of knowledge so that students can appreciate how scientific knowledge is reliable and repeatable. Students are given opportunity during science lessons to use their personal learning devices to tap on the affordances of technology to enhance their learning. The use of gamification makes lessons more engaging.
