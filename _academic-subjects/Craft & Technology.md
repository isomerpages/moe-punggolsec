## Craft &amp; Technology

The Craft &amp; Technology Department comprises of Art, Design and Technology (D&amp;T) and Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) units. All three subjects advocate a hands-on approach incorporating theory and practical skills for applied learning.

  

### Aims and Objectives of C&amp;T subjects


*   To equip students with knowledge and skills in Art, Design &amp; Technology and Nutrition and Food Science in order to prepare them for work-life and to inculcate lifelong learning in them.
*   To develop in our students the ability to handle authentic project based situations and to create effective solutions.
*   To maximise the creative capacity of every student by developing curiosity, experimentation, resourcefulness, and problem solving characteristic traits in them.

  

### Design and Technology Unit


Design and Technology Unit imparts various skills such as investigative and applied learning, resource and time management, technological knowledge, problem-solving skills, decision making and evaluation skills for authentic situations to our students. Various modes of assessment such as journal work, practical work, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based and flipped classroom assignments are used to assess the progress of students’ learning.

### Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) Unit


The NFS unit advocates a hands-on approach in the weekly lessons that are incorporated with theory, practical and coursework skills by using the visible thinking protocol,&nbsp;_I See, I Think, I Wonder_. The coursework integrates varied skills such as investigative, resource management, technological, time management, problem solving, decision-making, evaluation and thinking skills in a food-related problem-solving project. The various modes of assessment such as oral presentation, practical work, problem-solving tasks, ICT based assessments, report writing and experiments are based on a list of success criteria and used to assess the student’s work.

### Art Unit


The Art Department believes in stretching pupils' imagination and creativity by provoking their thinking and ability to respond aesthetically. Students are nurtured to have an informed awareness and appreciation for the Visual Arts which enhances their ability to identify and solve problems creatively. Students also develop competency in the art and design principles, materials and processes. These allow students to foster self-confidence and a sense of achievement through the practice of the art making, by cultivating an inquiring mind, a spirit of experimentation and a passion for the visual arts. The various mediums experienced, individual efforts through the processes and final art forms are used to assess the students’ learning.
