The Craft and Technology (C&amp;T) Department comprises of Art, Design and Technology (D&amp;T) and Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) units. All three subjects advocate a hands-on approach, incorporating theory and practical skills for applied learning.  The C&amp;T Department strives to nurture students to visualize and concretise solutions for real-world contexts.

Students are engaged in a variety of programmes aimed at stimulating their interest in learning. Some examples of these programmes include artist talks, learning journeys, and integrating technology into their learning experiences.
