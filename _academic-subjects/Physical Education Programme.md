The Physical Education Department, through the learning of sports, games and outdoor learning, provides opportunities for every Punggolite to acquire the skills and knowledge to build their character and values. We aim to prepare them to be active, healthy and future-ready individuals.

It is critical for students to enjoy learning. Fun-filled school events like the Secondary One Cohort Adventure Camp, Annual Cross Country, and Games Carnival Recreational Competitions provide ample opportunities for students to develop self-management, social awareness and, while practicing communication and collaborative skills when working in groups. These are essential skills to prepare students for their future beyond school.
