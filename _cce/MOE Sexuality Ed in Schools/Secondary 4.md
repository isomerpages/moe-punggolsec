  <p class=""><span class="" lang="EN-GB">This lesson aims to
  help students think critically about gender stereotypes that exist in our
  society in the contexts of career and family (e.g. males typically perceived
  as main breadwinners and females typically perceived as main caregivers in
  the family), and the impact of these stereotypes on individuals. Students
  will learn to be aware of possible gender stereotypes that may affect one’s
  family and future decisions. They will also learn to reframe their
  perspectives and not judge others based on their own or others’ values and
  principles, with regard to gender stereotypes.</span><span class="" lang="EN-GB"></span></p>

  lesson aims to help students recognise unhealthy relationships and build
  their help-seeking skills. Students will learn to identify potential signs of
  an unhealthy relationship and recognise the different forms of dating
  violence. They will get to understand why dating violence occurs, why victims
  often feel “trapped” in such unhealthy relationships, and how one can get out
  of such a relationship safely. Students will learn when, where and how to
  seek help from trusted adults (e.g. family, teachers, school counsellors) in
  the supportive environment that they have if they or their friends are
  involved in an unhealthy relationship.</span><span class="" lang="EN-GB"></span></p>

  on building a positive relationship with one’s partner in a marriage.
  Students will understand that while a marriage, defined in Singapore as a
  union between a man and a woman, requires mutual commitment and effort like
  the other relationships in their lives, what sets a marriage apart is its
  lifelong commitment. Students will learn that what really matters to sustain
  and maintain a long-term romantic relationship leading to marriage is
  understanding the other person’s perspective and effectively communicating
  with each other.&nbsp;</span><span class="" lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
