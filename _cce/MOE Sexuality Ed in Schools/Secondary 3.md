  lesson aims to help students think critically and make informed decisions in
  the contexts of sexting and voyeurism, and encourages students to exert a
  positive influence as a respectful online user. It will also deepen students’
  convictions about making moral decisions by taking into consideration the
  impact of their decisions and actions on their well-being and safety, their
  loved ones, and the community. Students learn that they have a right and
  responsibility to be safe and protect their personal space and body. They also
  learn that sexting, voyeurism and other related sexual offences are never
  justifiable and they can seek help in times of need.</span><span class="" lang="EN-SG"></span></p>
