## Character and Citizenship Education


The CCE committee supports the school's vision of providing a total curriculum that is forward-looking and builds students’ confidence and motivation through a values based education.  

  

The design of our CCE curriculum with clear and intentional outcomes is student-centric and customised to the developmental needs of Punggolites. The multi-faceted CCE curriculum that includes Values Education, Values-in-Action (VIA), Education &amp; Career Guidance, Cyberwellness, Sexuality Education, National Education and student-leadership, coupled with the myriad of learning experiences offered by PSS, seeks to develop these in our students:

  

1.  Good character: Have a sound moral compass, a strong sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence;

  

2.  Resilience and social-emotional well-being: Have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation;

  

3.  Active citizenship: Develop a strong national identity based on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singapore’s vulnerabilities and constraints, the will to act on improving the lives of others, and building a future for our nation; and

  

4.  Future readiness: Have a sense of purpose in life, develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning so as to be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and take on the challenges of the future, including the world of work.
