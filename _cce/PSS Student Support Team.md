<p><strong>CONTACT US</strong>
</p>
<p>Students and parents can speak to the form teachers or Year Heads about
any problems students may be facing. If additional support is required,
teachers will get in touch with parents to explore for a referral to the
PSSST.</p>

<p>**CONFIDENTIALLY**</p>
<p>Part of the counselling process involves a therapeutic relationship between
the student and counsellor. Confidentiality is maintained and information
is shared by the school counsellor on a need-to-know basis, with the exceptions
where safety becomes a concern to the student, or law has been breached.</p>
