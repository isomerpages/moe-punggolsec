## Aesthetics Programme

Aesthetics education in PSS provides students with the opportunity to be exposed to various genres of the arts. As students are engaged in their choice of art form, they are able to have an avenue for expression as they discover their own voice, grow confidently and develop empathy and appreciate beauty in the world through multiple perspectives.
