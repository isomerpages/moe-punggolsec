<p><strong>&nbsp;RELEASE OF 2024 SINGAPORE-CAMBRIDGE GCE O-LEVEL EXAMINATION RESULTS</strong>
</p>
<p>The 2024 O-Level results will be released soon. Regardless of the outcome,
it is important for our teens to know that they are loved for the person
that they have grown up to be, and that their grades do not define who
they are in our eyes. The support you offer your teen during this milestone
is especially necessary and valuable in helping your teen manage emotions
and be positive when deciding on next steps.</p>
<p>Do take this opportunity to have open conversations with your teen about
his/her interests and choices and build his/her pathways together.</p>
<p><strong>Resources for Parents and Students</strong>
</p>
<p>For more resources on providing social and emotional support, affirming
your teen, and supporting your teen’s transition through post O-Level education,
please refer to: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/selresforparents</a>.
You can also access <em>MySkillsFuture</em> Student Portal (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/mysfsec</a>) to find
out more about education and career planning for your teen. Students can
also refer to MOE’s CourseFinder (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/coursefinder</a>)
to find out more about the range of education and career pathways available
to them.</p>
<p><strong>ECG Counselling Support</strong>
</p>
<p>For <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ECG counselling services</a>,
students may book an appointment with our school’s ECG Counsellor,</p>
<p>Ms Grace Champion, at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/pssecg</a> or
make an ECG counselling session with the ECG Centre @ MOE from 6&nbsp;
to 16&nbsp;January 2025 (Weekdays: 9.00am to 5.00pm; Saturdays: 9.00am
to 12.00pm) through the appointment booking form <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of GCE O-Level Results</strong>
</p>
<p>All students are to return to their secondary schools to collect their
results. Those who are unable to collect their results in person can appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. Proxies
are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification
when collecting the results.</p>
