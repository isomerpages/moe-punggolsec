<p>The Aesthetics Programme in Punggol Secondary School provides students
with the opportunity to be exposed to various genres of the arts through
workshops and learning journeys. Assembly programmes such as “Fun with
Pop Music” by a 6 piece classical band, and “Dances of Asia” by Sri Warisan
helped to deepen students’ appreciation of the arts. A highlight this year
would be DREAM!, an external concert where students were invited to perform
for family and friends. This not only showed their passion and talent in
the arts but also their confidence, resilience and self-directedness in
the preparation and execution of the event.</p>
