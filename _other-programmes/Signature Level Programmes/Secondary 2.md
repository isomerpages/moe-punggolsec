<p>The Secondary Two year began meaningfully with a “Breakfast with Form
Teachers,” fostering stronger bonds between students and mentors. Through
Subject Combination Talks and continuous guidance, students were empowered
to make informed choices about their academic and personal goals. Student
Development Week offered diverse experiences, including a visit to the
Singapore Symphony Orchestra at the Victoria Concert Hall and an exploration
of the Civic District. As part of their Values in Action programme, students
planned and organised the lively Punggol Carnival, demonstrating teamwork,
leadership, and service. These experiences nurtured responsibility, self-direction,
and a deep sense of community.</p>
