<p><strong><em>Rock climbing activity at Secondary One Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our Secondary One Punggolites began their journey with a vibrant three-day
orientation programme filled with laughter, new friendships and a memorable
campfire night. The excitement continued with a three-day, two-night outdoor
camp that strengthened resilience and class spirit. During Student Development
Weeks, students explored coding, embarked on learning journeys, joined
their first-ever PSS Games Carnival, and took part in a self-leadership
workshop to enhance their confidence and communication skills. Through
these enriching and meaningful experiences, our Secondary Ones discovered
more about themselves, developed greater self-direction and adaptability,
and grew confidence to embrace the challenges and opportunities ahead.</p>
