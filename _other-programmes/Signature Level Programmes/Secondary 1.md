<p>2024 kicked off with an exciting three-day orientation. Our Secondary
One Punggolites dove into the schoolâ€™s culture, made new friends, and began
their journey of growth. In Term 2, they faced challenges during a 3-day,
2-night outdoor camp, building resilience and teamwork. Student Development
Week was packed with energy, as students proudly presented their Values-in-Action
(VIA) projects and enjoyed the fun of Math Games. They explored the rich
heritage of Kampong Glam, Chinatown, and Little India before embarking
on a learning journey to Kok Fah Farm and Urban Rooftop Farms. These activities
nurtured self-directed, adaptable learners, ready for future challenges.</p>
