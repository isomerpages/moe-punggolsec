</p>
<p>As the seniors of Punggol Secondary, our Secondary Four and Five students
led with purpose and pride - mentoring their juniors, striving for excellence,
and exemplifying the school’s core values. Through Project Autonomy, they
cultivated self-belief, supported one another and charted their shared
journeys with determination. Competing alongside peers from other schools,
they displayed perseverance, unity and school spirit at every stage. These
meaningful experiences strengthened friendships and created lasting memories.
As they look ahead, our graduating students are committed to excellence
and service, carrying forward the Punggolite legacy with pride and purpose.</p>
