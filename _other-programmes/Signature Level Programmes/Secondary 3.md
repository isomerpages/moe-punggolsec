<p><strong><em>First day of school bonding</em></strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>The Secondary Three Punggolites have had an exciting year, navigating
the transition from lower to upper secondary with enthusiasm and mutual
support. Four days were dedicated to class and cohort bonding, where students
strengthened their relationships with teachers and peers. During Student
Development Week, they engaged in activities like making soaps and bath
bombs in their Applied Learning Programme (ALP), while collaborating on
Values-in-Action (VIA) projects with external organizations. They also
explored Applied Elective Modules at ITE and Republic Polytechnic. Through
these experiences, the cohort has built resilience and demonstrated adaptability,
ready to take on future challenges with confidence.
