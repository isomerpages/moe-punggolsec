<p><strong><em>Sec 3 Aesthetic Learning Journey</em></strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>The Secondary Three year marked an exciting transition as students stepped
confidently into Upper Secondary. The year began with two days of bonding
activities, fostering new friendships and camaraderie. Through the applied
elective modules at ITE and various&nbsp;</p>
<p>polytechnics, students gained valuable insights into real-world learning.
During Student Development Week, they participated in engaging programmes
such as the Poly Taster Programme at Republic Polytechnic, financial literacy
workshops, mass dance sessions and student-led bonding activities. These
opportunities strengthened resilience, adaptability, and teamwork - qualities
that will empower our Secondary Threes to serve effectively and stride
forward with confidence.
