Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) focuses on, Community and Youth Leadership. Through our LLP, we aim to nurture future-ready Punggolites who are adaptable and actively contribute back to their community. 

Our LLP programme also serves as a platform for Punggolites to collaborate and work towards common goals. It is one where a sense of community is nurtured, where Punggolites learn about being empathetic and the importance of being an active contributor in our community.
