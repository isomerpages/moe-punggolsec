<p>Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) focuses on, Community and Youth
Leadership. Through our LLP, we aim to nurture future-ready Punggolites
who are adaptable and actively contribute back to their community.</p>
<p>Our LLP programme also serves as a platform for Punggolites to collaborate
and work towards common goals. It is one where a sense of community is
nurtured, where Punggolites learn about being empathetic and the importance
of being an active contributor in our community.</p>
