<p>The school envisions that students will become confident citizens and
leaders, guided by values and motivated to excel. Globalisation has created
sociocultural and socio-economic conditions that are volatile, uncertain,
complex and ambiguous.</p>
<p>The Overseas Learning Journey (OLJ) equips students with the necessary
21st century competencies and develop their cross-cultural skills and sensitivities.
This Internationalisation Programme prepares students to be future-ready
as they graduate from the position of strength.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cultural Immersion to Ho Chi Minh</u></strong>
</p>
This Overseas Learning Journey (OLJ) to Ho Chi Minh provides a valuable
opportunity for students to appreciate the history and geography of Vietnam,
and the everyday lives of the Vietnamese. This OLJ aims to help students
develop cross-cultural skills and global awareness, through visits to the
War Remnants Museum and Cu-Chi Tunnels, the Mekong Delta, as well as exchanges
with local high school students. By immersing themselves in Vietnamâ€™s innovation,
dynamism and rich heritage, it has helped students develop critical thinking
skills, adaptability and respect, which are key traits to thrive in a rapidly
evolving and interconnected world.<p></p>
