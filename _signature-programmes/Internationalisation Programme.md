## Internationalisation Programme

The school envisions that our students will become confident citizens and leaders, guided by values and motivated to excel. Globalisation has created socio-cultural and socio-economic conditions that are volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Beyond the acquisition of knowledge and cultural understanding, it is in our philosophy that education is a journey of self-discovery. Away from the comfort of home, students are given opportunities to experience and appreciate the diversity and opportunities available in the different ASEAN countries the students visit. The experiences gained from these trips would witness a paradigm shift of students’ thinking where they reframe how societal issues are viewed, understand many lessons of life and better appreciate the things they have rather than being disgruntled with things they do not (yet) possess. Above all, they would learn to appreciate that while the _good life_, the prosperity and socio-cultural conditions in Singapore that all are enjoying and indulging in is free, these conditions come at a price, a price that has been borne by those before us. The Overseas Learning Journey (OLJ) equips students with the necessary 21st century competencies and develop their cross-cultural skills and sensitivities. This prepares our students to be future-ready as they graduate from the position of strength.  

  

While the programmes of the various OLJs are different, they are designed to cultivate the learning of values and development of the students in the area of 21st century competencies. This is done through OLJs focusing on Values-in-Action (VIA), cultural exchanges, immersion programmes, as well as leadership developments. In the end, the destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing things.
