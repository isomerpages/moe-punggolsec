<p>Environmental Sustainability is our school’s signature programme to promote
adaptive thinking.</p>
<p>Our school partners with Science Centre to design lesson packages to teach
students about block programming and to create a "smart" hydroponic system
in our hydroponic farm. Allowing our students to leverage technology to
monitor plant growth equips them to be future-ready.</p>
<p>Our students participated in Singapore Institute of Technology Community
Challenge (SITCC), which challenges participants to co-create STEM solutions
to promote sustainability for the community. Our students collectively
achieved “Most Engaging Award”, “Most Impactful Award” and “Most Inspiring
Award”.</p>
