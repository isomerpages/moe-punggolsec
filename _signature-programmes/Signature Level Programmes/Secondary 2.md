**PROGRAMMES**

  

**_Subject Streaming Talk for Secondary Two students_**

  

This annual talk serves as an avenue to provide information on the different subject prerequisites and tentative subject combinations for the following year. As it is their streaming year, this helps parents and students make informed decisions and understand the various post-secondary pathways available.

  

  

**_National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) Camp_**

  

Every year, Secondary 2 students participate in the NYAA camp, which serves as an opportunity for students to develop self-confidence, resilience and perseverance. During this cohort camp, students participate in a range of activities which promote team spirit, improve communication skills and help to enhance social interaction through various team-building activities. As it is also the first time that most students are staying at a campsite, it encourages students to show care and concern for others. This camp also contributes to the students’ achievements of the NYAA Bronze Award.

  

  

**_Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme_**

  

Students participate in VIA activities in the community so that they can learn and appreciate their living environment. Students take on the role of being responsible citizens practising good neighbourliness, responsible heartland living and good water and energy conservation lifestyles. These activities give students the opportunity to demonstrate the school values of propriety and righteousness as they educate others in the community about graciousness and eco-living.
