<p>The Secondary Two Punggolites started 2024 with a delightful "Breakfast
with Form Teachers," to reconnect and strengthen bonds. Throughout the
year, students were encouraged to make wise choices in all aspects of their
school life. Subject combination talks and Education and Career Guidance
programmes empowered them to make informed decisions for their Secondary
Three subject combination. In Term 2, Student Development Week brought
exciting activities like museum visits, the HDB outreach programme, and
Values-in-Action showcases, along with a vibrant cohort mass dance. These
experiences helped Punggolites strengthen teamwork, adaptability, and self-directedness,
setting the stage for a dynamic year ahead.</p>
