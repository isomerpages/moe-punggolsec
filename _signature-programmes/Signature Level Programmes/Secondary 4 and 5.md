<p>As the most senior students, the Secondary Four and Five cohort takes
great pride in mentoring their juniors, leading by example in all they
do. This year, through Project Eveready, we focused on building self-confidence
and adaptive thinking to face the challenges of an uncertain future. Activities
like raft building, orienteering, and presentations taught us the power
of determination and a positive mindset in overcoming obstacles. We’ve
pushed our boundaries in competitions, continually challenging ourselves
to reach new heights.</p>
<p>As we approach our inaugural Graduation Tea, let’s keep inspiring one
another, striving for excellence, and leaving a lasting legacy.</p>
