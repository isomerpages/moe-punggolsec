### Parents’ involvement in past events


The PSG has been active in encouraging parents to participate in the various parenting talks and school programmes such as the Annual Cross Country and Breakfast with Parents. In 2019, the PSG not only supported school programmes through the members’ participation in the various activities, but was also involved in planning and conducting several of such programmes.

  

When the elderly from Bright Hill Evergreen Home joined us for our Chinese New Year Celebrations, PSG members taught students how to interact with the elderly and how best to manoeuvre their wheelchairs. During Project Resilience, they not only participated in the walk from Changi Coast Road to school. They also greeted the students with a nice refreshing energy drink at the end of their journey.

  

The PSG also paid tribute to teachers during the Teachers’ Day lunch with the song ‘Top of the World’ and recited a poem celebrating the importance of the partnership between parents and teachers in moulding a child. Each staff was presented with a gift set of reusable stainless steel straws to support the school’s environmental consciousness effort.

  

The PSG also initiated and supported the family bonding activity ‘Dialogue in the Dark’ @ Ngee Ann Polytechnic on 25 October 2019. This programme aims to emphasise the father’s role in a family. The PSG also supported the Meals for Night Study initiative, where students may buy a sumptuous meal for $1 twice a week.

  

Yearly, the PSG will set up a booth at the school Open House to engage visiting parents and their children with a craft activity and answer enquiries from parents about the school. Similarly, during the Secondary One registration, parent volunteers were also on hand to assist and welcome new parents.
