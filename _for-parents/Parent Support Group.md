<h3>Parents’ involvement in past events</h3>
<p>The PSG has been active in encouraging parents to participate in various
parenting talks and school programmes such as the Annual Cross Country
2023 and Parents Career Sharing Session.</p>
<p>When the elderly from Bright Hill Evergreen Home joined us for our Chinese
New Year Celebrations, PSG members taught students how to interact with
the elderly and how best to manoeuvre their wheelchairs. During Project
Resilience, they not only participated in the walk from Changi Coast Road
to school. They also greeted the students with a nice refreshing energy
drink at the end of their journey.</p>
<p>The PSG also paid tribute to teachers during the Teachers’ Day lunch with
the song ‘Top of the World’ and recited a poem celebrating the importance
of the partnership between parents and teachers in moulding a child. Each
staff was presented with a gift set of reusable stainless steel straws
to support the school’s environmental consciousness effort.</p>
<p>The PSG also initiated and supported the family bonding activity ‘Dialogue
in the Dark’ @ Ngee Ann Polytechnic on 25 October 2019. This programme
aims to emphasise the father’s role in a family. The PSG also supported
the Meals for Night Study initiative, where students may buy a sumptuous
meal for $1 twice a week.</p>
<p>Yearly, the PSG will set up a booth at the school Open House to engage
visiting parents and their children with a craft activity and answer enquiries
from parents about the school. Similarly, during the Secondary One registration,
parent volunteers were also on hand to assist and welcome new parents.</p>
