Parents can register for the rental of the locker <strong>from 24 Jan 2024</strong> <strong>onwards</strong> and make payment of $26/year for the rental services directly to the vendor through this link: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.rent-a-locker.com</a>. The school locker uses password to open the lock provided by the vendor and the password will be sent to the child/wardâ€™s registered email account (<em><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">studentname@students.edu.sg</a></em>) after payment is received.</p><p>Students on Financial Assistance Schemes will also pay $26/year for the rental services. A school subsidy of $6 will be refunded at a later date. Students who need additional support with the locker rental may write in to the school to apply and provide supporting documents.&nbsp;</p><p>The step-by-step process on how to rent a locker can be found here: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.punggolsec.moe.edu.sg/for-parents/rent-a-locker/steps-to-rent-locker/</a></p><p></p>
