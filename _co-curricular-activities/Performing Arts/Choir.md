</p>
<p>Punggol Secondary School Choir’s motto is Strength in Diversity as each
student is given a voice to express themselves through singing.</p>
<p>We participated in National University of Singapore (NUS)’s Singathon.
We also achieved the Certificate of Accomplishment for Singapore Youth
Festival (SYF) 2023. In 2024, our choir was selected to be featured in
the National Day Parade performance. We performed in Voices of Singapore
Festival Concert in September and were invited to perform for the groundbreaking
ceremony for the Cross-Island line – Punggol Extension in October.</p>
<p>Our hope is for our students to become confident singers through these
various performances.</p>
