<p>ELDDS enables members to be confident speakers and skilled actors through
the various programmes mapped out throughout the year. Students learn to
step out of their<s> </s>comfort zones and be more resilient through their
participation in the Singapore Youth Festival as well as the Singapore
Secondary School Debating Championships. Some selected Secondary One students
also took part in the Choral Reading category of the National Schools Literature
Festival in July for which they won a Commendation Award. Students are
looking forward to many more opportunities that will help them strengthen
their character through such creative programmes.</p>
