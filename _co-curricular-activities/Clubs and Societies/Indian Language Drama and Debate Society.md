<p><strong><em>Is it Indian Dance or Chinese Dance?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The Indian Language Drama and Debating Society (ILDDS) is about poised
poses and graceful facial expressions. It instil<s>l</s>s in students a
strong sense of discipline, respect for both the guru and dance form, as
well as self-assurance, fortitude, and teamwork. To demonstrate their creativity
and dance prowess, the students were also given a chance to choreograph
brief musical selections.</p>
<p>ILDDS was awarded with the Certificate of Distinction Award in the 2023
Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. ILDDS also performed
a lively and fast-paced folk dance during National Day Celebrations. The
coordination in this performance represents the unity of Singaporeans.</p>
