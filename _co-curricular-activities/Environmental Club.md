</p>
<p>The Environmental Club is committed to promoting environmental awareness
and spearheading green campaigns.</p>
<p>This year, the club launched an e-waste campaign in conjunction with Earth
Hour, promoting a sustainable lifestyle as we work towards net-zero emissions.
Such student-initiated projects helped the school clinch the SGA Vanda
Miss Joaquim Sustained Achievement Award in 2022&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Extending their conservation efforts beyond school, members participated
in Tree Planting Day at Pasir Ris Town Park and conducted environmental
clean-up at Changi Beach. Their bird-monitoring efforts in school also
helped them clinch the Third Place for the 'Highest Number of Observations
in 2022' by Nature Society Singapore.</p>
