<p>Art Club believes that art is used as a bridge for expression. We hope
to nurture students’ interest, creativity and self-expression in art through
exploring and experimenting with different art forms and mediums.</p>

<p>Highlights of 2023 include the club’s active re-creation of the Koi corner
by painting a mural of ceramic koi fishes at the site where the koi pond
once existed. In addition, Art Club’s upper secondary members participated
in the annual National Organ Transplant Unit (NOTU) Live on Design Competition,
while the lower secondary members participated in the Punggol Jewel Resident
Network Poster Design Competition.</p>
