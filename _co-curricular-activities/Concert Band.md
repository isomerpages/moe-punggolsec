<p>Punggol Secondary School Concert Band believes that the beauty of music
connects people together and forges meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of our esteemed Band Director, Mr. Tan Beng Wee, Band
was awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment Award in Singapore Youth
Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our journey of collaborating with Choir continues as we foster a
stronger sense of belonging to PSS and cultivate school pride in our members.
Together, we presented a nostalgic performance of previous National Day's
theme songs – &nbsp;’Home’ and ‘Where I Belong’, evoking a sense of national
pride and reminder of our roots to Singapore.</p>
