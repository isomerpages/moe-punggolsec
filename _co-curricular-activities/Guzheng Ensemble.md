<p>Guzheng Ensemble strives to inspire students to appreciate the Chinese
music and culture. We aim to provide platforms to develop our studentsâ€™
character and skills that will prepare them for the future. The two highlights
for 2024 are the School Exchange Programme with Admiralty Secondary School
and DREAM! School Aesthetic Concert.</p>
