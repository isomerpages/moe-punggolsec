<p>With the introduction of the new school polo t-shirt, Secondary One students
are expected to wear their polo t-shirt with their skirt or pants on Monday.
Students can wear either the polo t-shirt or PE t-shirt with their skirt
or pants from Tuesday to Friday.</p>
<p>Your child/ward will receive his/her individual timetable in the first
week of the school year from his/her form teacher.</p>
<p>CCAs are usually held on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>
<p>Students can only fully benefit from the school’s curriculum by actively
participating in all school activities including Co-curricular Activities
(CCA), Values-in-Action (VIA), Learning Journeys (LJ), enrichment programmes,
as well as school events and celebrations such as the Speech and Awards
Day, National Day Celebrations and cross-country.</p>
<p>The school takes a serious view of students’ attendance and participation
in learning. Any absence from school must be supported with a medical certificate.
A maximum of two letters from parents are allowed per semester for other
valid absences from school. However, do note that letters from parents
will NOT be accepted as valid reasons for absence from school-based assessments.</p>
