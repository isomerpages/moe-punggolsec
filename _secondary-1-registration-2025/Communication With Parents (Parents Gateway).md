<p>The Parents Gateway (PG) Mobile App is an initiative by the Ministry of
Education to facilitate communication between the school and parents on
administrative and financial matters. Parents will also be able to use
this app to stay updated on the school’s programmes and activities. If
you have two or more children and they are in different schools, you will
be able to receive notifications for all your children on the same PG App.</p>
<p>The free app will bring several benefits, including:</p>
<p>• Provide parents with timely information about school events.</p>
<p>• Enable parents to perform a range of functions including giving consent
for school activities.</p>
<p>• Reducing usage of paper and decreasing environmental impact.</p>
