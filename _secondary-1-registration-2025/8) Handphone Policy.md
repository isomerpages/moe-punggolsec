<p>Starting in 2025, students will be required to store their handphones
in designated lockers during Form Teacher time after morning assembly and
will only be permitted to retrieve the handphones at the end of the school
day. This measure aims to promote students to be more focused and engaged
during their learning while cultivating healthy peer interactions. We seek
your understanding to contact the General Office instead if you need to
get in touch with your child/ward during curriculum time for urgent matters.</p>
<p>If students are caught using their handphones during curriculum hours,
including break time, their devices will be confiscated. The students will
have to serve a 30-minute detention at the end of the school day before
they can get their handphones back. This measure is intended to serve as
a deterrent and to reinforce the importance of respect for school rules.</p>
<p>While the school puts in place processes and structures to regulate handphone
usage, we will also continue to educate and guide our students in developing
healthy handphone usage habits. We appreciate your support in reinforcing
these messages at home.</p>
