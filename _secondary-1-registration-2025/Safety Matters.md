<h3>Road Safety</h3>
<p>All students are to use the pedestrian crossings and overhead bridges
when crossing roads. They are expected to observe the road safety rules.</p>
<h3>Students Arriving in School By Private Transport</h3>
<p>Parents/Guardians who are driving their child/ward to school are requested
to alight them outside the school premises, at the designated areas marked
out by cones to facilitate a smooth flow of traffic. Our security guards
will be available to assist you further.</p>
<p>During wet weather, we will allow parents/guardians to drive into the
school premises so that students can alight at the sheltered porch.</p>
<h3>Early Departure From School</h3>
<p>When a student falls ill in school, the parent/guardian will be informed
to bring the student to see a doctor. Students are required to inform their
form teachers and the receptionist if they are unwell. Early departures
from school are recorded and an acknowledgement letter from the parents/guardians
or medical certificate must be given to the school on the following day.</p>
