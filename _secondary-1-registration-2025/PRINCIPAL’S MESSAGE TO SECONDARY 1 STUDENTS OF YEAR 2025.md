<p>Dear Secondary One students,</p>
<p>Welcome to Punggol Secondary School (培道). You are about to embark on a

active contributor to the community. Such an endeavour requires dedication
and perseverance on your part.</p>
<p>By investing your time and energy meaningfully, you will reap positive
rewards. Participate actively in school activities, whether academic, sports,
aesthetics or community involvement programmes, and you will see yourself
develop confidence and grow from strength to strength. The teachers and
staff in school will be your mentors and guides. Treat them with respect
and work together with them to unlock your fullest potential. We are always
here to listen to your ideas or concerns. Our goal is to create a vibrant
and nurturing environment that empowers your growth and development.</p>
<p>The future is yours to shape and you hold the power to determine the path
