<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>A warm welcome to Punggol Secondary School!</p>
<p>This package is designed to help you gain a better understanding about
the school, including our policies and processes, as we work together to
ensure that your child/ward’s Secondary School experience is enriching
and fulfilling.</p>
<p>You and your child/ward are not required to come to school for registration.
Instead, this package aims to provide you with all the necessary information
for your child’s/ward’s registration at Punggol Secondary School for 2025.</p>
<p>Please also sign up for the Parents Gateway App (instructions on page
5) which will serve as the primary communication channel between the school
and you.</p>
<p>Our school leaders will conduct a parent engagement session with all Secondary
One parents/guardians on 10 January 2025 (Friday) from 5.45pm to 7.00pm
at our school. Parents/Guardians are invited to stay for the Secondary
One Orientation Week concert after the session. A separate notification
will be sent through Parents Gateway in due time.</p>
<p>Should you require any further clarifications, please contact Secondary
One Assistant Year Heads, Ms Noor Hafizah, or Mr Royce Teo, at 6489 7851.
You may also email us at <a href="mailto:noor_hafizah_alwi@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">noor_hafizah_alwi@schools.gov.sg</a> or

</p>
<p>We look forward to partnering with you and your child/ward on this important
journey.</p>
<p>With warmest regards,</p>
<p>Principal and Staff of Punggol Secondary School</p>
