</p>
<p>Computer Applications (CPA), Elements of Business (EBS), Mobile Robotics
(MR) and Principles of Accounts (POA) advocate for critical thinking as
part of their curriculum. Through a hands-on approach, lessons involve
incorporating theory and practical skills for applied learning. POA lessons
are designed by using authentic scenarios for students to analyse accounting
and non-accounting information to help businesses make decisions.</p>
<p>The MR and CPA Units strives to equip students with concrete and hands-on
learning connected to real-life applications. The EBS Unit explores the
use of Virtual Reality, it increases student engagement and encourages
critical thinking of the content and concepts learned.</p>
