<p><strong><em>Secondary 3 Students on a Math Trail</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The Mathematics Department aims to develop Punggolites into resilient
problem solvers with a positive attitude towards Mathematics. The department
leverages on a baseline curriculum with suitable pedagogies and assessment
strategies to strengthen the teaching and learning of mathematical problem-solving
skills. Programmes like Peer Tutoring Programme, Foundation to N(A) Bridging,
Secondary One Games Day and Secondary Three Math Trail provide a motivating
environment to learn Mathematics and solve problems in real world contexts.
Students learn how to be an active contributor as they work collaboratively
to support one another in problem-solving.</p>
